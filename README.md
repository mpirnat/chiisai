# Chiisai: a cute little URL shortener

Chiisai is a very small URL shortener, written as an intellectual
exercise/excuse to try out a new web framework.

It provides:

* A human-friendly web interface for creating new short URLs
* The ability to claim custom short URL aliases (overriding the default hashing
  behavior)
* A machine-friendly API suitable for use with client apps (eg, Tweetbot) that
  integrate custom URL shortening services
